# 🌤 Real-Time Weather App

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Real-Time Weather App** built as **Task-05** during my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The app fetches live weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays:
- 🌡 Temperature  
- 🌤 Weather condition  
- 💧 Humidity

The UI is clean, responsive, and allows searching by city name or using the device's current location.
